# UI

Package responsible for the app Design System.

It contains the visual tokens, such as colors, fonts, icons, and spacings values.

It also contains the sharable views that the app may use:

- JButton: The button with the expected style within two configurations: `.primary` or `.secondary`.
- JFloatButtons: Given many buttons desired, it shows them in a float view.
- JTile: A Tile view.
- JError: An empty screen showing an error message.
- JWIP: An empty screen showing that a feature is under construction.

Besides that, it also holds some extensions and utils code related to the UI.
